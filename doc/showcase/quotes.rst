Block Quotes
------------

https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#block-quotes

    A block quote may end with an attribution:
    a text block beginning with ``--``, ``---``, or a true em-dash,
    flush left within the block quote.
    If the attribution consists of multiple lines,
    the left edges of the second and subsequent lines must align.

    -- ``docutils`` documentation

    Multiple block quotes may occur consecutively
    if terminated with attributions::

        Unindented paragraph.

            Block quote 1.

            --Attribution 1

            Block quote 2.

    Empty comments may be used to explicitly terminate preceding constructs
    that would otherwise consume a block quote::

        * List item.

        ..

            Block quote 3.

    Empty comments may also be used to separate block quotes::

            Block quote 4.

        ..

            Block quote 5.

    Blank lines are required before and after a block quote,
    but these blank lines are not included as part of the block quote.
